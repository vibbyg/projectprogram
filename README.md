# A Multi-user Drawing Program

A porting to Glitch of a [little application developed 
by Dan Shiffman](https://youtu.be/bjULmG8fqc8) in a video
series from way back in 2016. I used a more modern version 
of JavaScript.

## Instructions:

Fork this project and run it in Glitch. It will run
the server on your machine, as well as a client, if
you "Show" the app.

Then go to another browser window or tab and go to
"https://waterloo-coop.glitch.me" and a client
canvas will appear. Draw in both canvases and you
will see the drawings appear in all windows in real
time. _Your_ window will see drawing in white, and
drawings from other windows will appear in red.
